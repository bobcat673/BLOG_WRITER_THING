OUTPUT>  I recently purchased Bulksupplements Creatine Monohydrate Powder and I am very pleased with my purchase. The powder is of high quality, with 5000mg of pure, micronized creatine per serving. The powder is also free of fillers and is unflavored, making it easier to add to beverages and shakes. The 500 gram bag provides an impressive 100 servings, making it a great value purchase. I find the powder easy to dissolve and have noticed an increase in my strength and endurance since I began using it. I highly recommend Bulksupplements Creatine Monohydrate Powder and will continue to use it in the future.<END
